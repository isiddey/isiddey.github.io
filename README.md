# isiddey.github.io
A very simple website (with blog feature) made for learning purpose. This is created to teach new web-developers to use Github Pages. It uses a traditional navigation system which is not at all optimal but easy to learn. The design is kept simple and straight forward. 

For the short time, I am also using this as my personal website.

Technology used : HTML/CSS, Bootstrap 3.3.7, Javascript.

Feel free to contact for projects and more!
